This is my fork of vimroom which includes following:

* A special mode for editing Markdown and reStructuredText. It's highly inspired by  [iA Writer](http://writer.pro/)
* Optimizations for [my vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)

Please read more here [
zenroom for Vim: Focusing only on the essential](http://amix.dk/blog/post/19744#zenroom-for-Vim-Focsuing-only-on-the-essential).

**Important:** A new version is out that's based on Goyo.vim. It's not a fork
of vimroom. Get it at [vim-zenroom2](https://github.com/amix/vim-zenroom2)!
